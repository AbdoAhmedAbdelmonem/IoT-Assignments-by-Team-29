# 🧮 Problem 10: Add Binary

## 🧾 Task

Given two **binary strings** `a` and `b`, return their **sum** as a binary string.

## 💡 Examples

```txt
Input: a = "11", b = "1"      → Output: "100"
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011" → Output: "10101"
```

## 🔒 Constraints
- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10⁴

- a and b contain only '0' and '1'

- No leading zeros unless the string is "0"
