# 🔁 Additional Problem: Palindrome Check

## 🧾 Task

Write a program that checks whether a given string is a **palindrome**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters (if specified).

## 🧠 Requirements

- Accept a string input from the user.
- Normalize the string by:
  - Converting to lowercase.
  - Optionally removing non-alphanumeric characters.
- Check if the normalized string is equal to its reverse.
- Output whether it is a palindrome or not.

## 💡 Examples

```txt
Input: "Racecar"
Output: Yes, it's a palindrome.

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: Yes, it's a palindrome.

Input: "Hello"
Output: No, it's not a palindrome.
```
## 🔒Constraints
- 1 <= input.length <= 1000

- Case-insensitive comparison
